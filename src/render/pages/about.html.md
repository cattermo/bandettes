# About us

The Bandettes is a Swedish band consisting of Anna, Hannah, Kajsa and Emeli formed in 2011, playing Pop/Americana-music with a smell of sunshine, a shimmer of northern lights and a sense of humour. Take me home, released August 25th 2013, is The Bandettes debut album and their first journey together. It is inspired by the old trains steady rhythm and the landscape passing by outside the window. It's an album of contradictions, playful but serious, with warm vocal harmonies but recorded in the cold Nordic winter, and it's influenced by the fight between the feeling of freedom while travelling and the feeling of homesickness. The album was recorded in the south Swedish countryside in the winter of 2012, and while recording the summer sounding songs the band was literally snowed in.

The first single, The Beard Song, from the debut album was first recorded as a demo in Nashville, where the singer/guitarplayer Anna travelled a few years ago searching for new inspiration. When she got home and reunited with her childhood friend Hannah (with whom she had been busking with back in their teens), the pieces of the puzzle started to come together. The last two parts were Kajsa and Emeli, who brought the jazzinfluences to the Americana/Pop-sound, and made the band complete. In order to keep the creative control, the band members have been co-producers on the album, which is released on their own label Take me home Productions.

The Bandettes has been called one of Swedens most promising new bands, and when the video to The Beard Song was released, it was quickly spread all over the world. It was within a week seen by people in 70 different countries, shared hundreds of times in the social media, and has now been played in Swedish and German radio, and acknowledged by blogs and papers. The Bandettes seem to be on the right track – who knows where their journey will take them next?
